# Part 2: Bridging skills - how to get an edge?
Well, if you have read [part 1](./pre_freshie_1.md), hope you got an idea of 
what is CE is all about (that's better than me a few years ago). If you have made up your mind to apply to NTU SCSE CE programme, I wish you the best of luck. If you have gotten a spot, this guide is for you!

The foundation of CE is a mixture of Math, Physics and Programming. Not everybody is well-versed in them when matriculated (NS-men have to served for 2 years after their tertiary education while international students may struggle with English). This part is my advice on how you can bridge these gaps and get ready for the best 4 years of your life.
