# Overview 
Computer Engineering is one of the 3 major that SCSE NTU offers. The course has a balance emphasis in both software and hardware of the computing system. Future computer engineer are expected to learn a variety of topics from classic Computer Science (Algorithms, Data Structure, OS) to Electronic skills (Circuits, Analog filters, communications, DSP), to Physical systems (embedded microprocessors, microcontroller programming, etc).

The curriculum has been revamped since 2018 for the better of next few batches of students. If you are now a student of SCSE, you can rest assure that you are in a good place!

As the last student of the previous curriculum, who get to experience part of the new and part of the old curriculum, I created this repo with the hope that my experience in this school can benefits Computer Engineers Juniors joining this course. These are my honest opinion and I really hope to have helped you all.
